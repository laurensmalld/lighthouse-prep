<section><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>6 oz. of uncooked pasta (macaroni is the traditional choice but you do you here)</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons oil (or vegan butter)</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons of your favourite non-dairy milk (I use almond)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup vegan cheez sauce mix (get the instructions for how to make your own <a href="http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2016/02/homemade-boxed-mac-cheese-vegan-friendly.html">here</a>)</li>
	</ul>
<h3>How to make it</h3>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> 
<ol>
	<li>Cook your pasta according to package directions. While it's cooking, get the rest of the ingredients ready -- this is a quick dish to make so the faster you go, the sooner you can be eating!</li> 
	<li>Drain water from pasta and leave the pasta in the strainer for a couple minutes while you whisk the sauce ingredients together in the warm pot.</li> 
	<li>Once the oil/butter is melted and the cheez sauce mix has been fully mixed in, add the cooked pasta back to the pot.</li>
	<li>Stir to completely coat the pasta with sauce.</li>
	<li>Add a little salt and pepper to taste and <em>voila</em> -- you've got a vegan dinner!</li></p>
